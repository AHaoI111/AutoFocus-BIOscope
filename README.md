This is a modular automated microscope project.

It is designed to build a modular and automated microscope system that is easy to integrate and assemble. 

The software part includes features such as autofocus and automatic microbial identification using built-in recognition models.

Firstly, you must have the supported hardware: a camera and a modular motorized microscope. 

Secondly, you need to place the model in the model/ directory (model download link: link：https://pan.baidu.com/s/1V6RZauGDAlvvb9XeouCPqw?pwd=1234 
The extraction code：1234). 
Of course, you can also train your own model according to your needs.
