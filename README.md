Modular automated microscope speeds up AI

It is designed to build a modular and automated microscope system that is easy to integrate and assemble. Improve efficiency in scientific research, medical diagnosis, production inspection and other fields, help researchers obtain large amounts of data faster, and accelerate experimental and research progress.


In the software part, you can modify the modules appropriately according to your own needs to realize the application of automatic focusing, automatic scanning, and AI models.

# Function introduction:

- 1Provides automatic autofocus function.
- 2Automatically plans the path based on the actual scanned area (in mm).
- 3Multiple autofocus modes: single autofocus for full-slide scanning, autofocus for each scan in region scanning, and intelligent autofocus.
- 4dual camera system


Firstly, you must have the supported hardware: a camera and a modular motorized microscope. 

Secondly, you need to place the model in the model/ directory (model download link: linkÔºöhttps://pan.baidu.com/s/1V6RZauGDAlvvb9XeouCPqw?pwd=1234 
The extraction codeÔºö1234). 
Of course, you can also train your own model according to your needs.
